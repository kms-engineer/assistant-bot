## 🎯 About KeepInMind

**KeepInMind** is a personal CLI assistant designed to streamline contact and note management through an intelligent command-line interface. This project represents a modern approach to personal information management, combining traditional software engineering excellence with cutting-edge AI capabilities.

### 👥 Development Team

This project was developed by a dedicated team of six engineers:

- **Mykyta Kotenko** - Team Lead & Developer
- **Anastasiia Chorna** - Developer
- **Oleksandr Popov** - Developer
- **Hlib Boiko** - Developer
- **Volodymyr Shapovalov** - Developer

### 🎯 Problem & Solution

**The Challenge:**
Modern professionals struggle with scattered contact information across multiple platforms, applications, and devices. Finding a phone number, checking someone's birthday, or locating a specific note often involves searching through emails, messaging apps, and various contact management tools.

**Our Solution:**
KeepInMind provides a unified, intelligent CLI interface that:
- Centralizes all contact and note information in one place
- Offers both traditional command syntax and natural language input
- Integrates with AI assistants via Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Ensures data privacy by keeping everything local
- Provides instant access without switching between applications

### 💪 Development Challenges

**2. Data Structure Agreement**
- Aligning on entity models, value objects, and database schema
- Ensuring backward compatibility during schema evolution
- Solution: Adopted Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles with clear bounded contexts

**3. NLP Integration Complexity**
- Balancing ML model accuracy with performance
- Handling edge cases in natural language understanding
- Solution: Implemented hybrid approach with ML models and rule-based fallback

**4. Cross-Platform Testing**
- Ensuring consistent behavior across operating systems
- Managing different Python environments and dependencies

## 🔌 MCP Integration (Claude Desktop)

Connect the bot to Claude Desktop for AI-powered interactions.

### Setup (3 minutes)

**1. Create MCP configuration:**

```bash
# macOS/Linux
nano ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

# Windows
notepad %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

**2. Add configuration:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "assistant-bot": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["-m", "src.web.server_stdio"],
      "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/assistant-bot"
    }
  }
}
```

**3. Replace the path:**
```bash
# Get your project path
pwd
# Copy the output and paste it in the config above
```

**4. Restart Claude Desktop**

### Running MCP Server

The MCP server can run in two modes:

**Automatic (via Claude Desktop):**
When you configure Claude Desktop as shown above, it automatically starts the MCP server when needed. No manual action required.

**Manual (for testing):**
You can also run the MCP server manually for testing or development:

```bash
# Run MCP server in stdio mode (for Claude Desktop integration)
python3 -m src.web.server_stdio

# Or run the standalone MCP server
python3 -m src.web.server
```

The server will start and wait for connections. Use Ctrl+C to stop it.

### Using with Claude

Now you can control the bot through Claude:

```
You: "Add a contact named Sarah with phone 555-1234"
Claude: I'll add that contact for you
Result: Contact added successfully

You: "Show all my contacts"
Claude: Here are your contacts: ...

You: "Create a note: Call Sarah tomorrow"
Claude: Note created with ID: ...
```

### Available MCP Tools (39 total)

- All contact management functions
- All note operations
- Search and filtering
- Tag management
- Birthday tracking

# Organize with tags
Add tag <note-id> work
Add tag <note-id> urgent

# Search
Search contacts Alice
Search notes meeting
Show notes tagged work

# Birthday reminders
Show birthdays for next 30 days
```

### Automation Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# bulk_import.sh - Import contacts from file

while IFS=',' read -r name phone email birthday; do
  echo "add $name $phone" | python3 -m src.presentation.cli.main
  echo "add-email $name $email" | python3 -m src.presentation.cli.main
  echo "add-birthday $name $birthday" | python3 -m src.presentation.cli.main
done < contacts.csv

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### NLP Mode Issues

**Problem**: Models not loading
```bash
# Solution: Clear cache and re-download
rm -rf ~/.cache/huggingface/
python3 -m src.presentation.cli.main --nlp
```

**Problem**: Out of memory
```bash
# Solution: Use classic mode or increase RAM
python3 -m src.presentation.cli.main  # Classic mode uses <100MB
```

### Database Issues

**Problem**: Database schema errors
```bash
# Solution: Delete old database (data will be lost)
rm ~/.assistant-bot/data/addressbook.db
python3 -m src.presentation.cli.main
```

### MCP Issues

**Problem**: Claude Desktop can't find bot
```bash
# Solution 1: Check path in config
pwd  # Copy this exact path to claude_desktop_config.json

# Solution 2: Use absolute path
"cwd": "/Users/yourname/path/to/assistant-bot"

# Solution 3: Test stdio manually
python3 -m src.web.server_stdio
```
